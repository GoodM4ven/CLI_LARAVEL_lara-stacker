## Introduction

Laravel Sail's [DevContainer](https://laravel.com/docs/sail#using-devcontainers) setup is great, except when it **relies on VSC and its extensions to keep up and Docker not outsmarting everybody!** Meanwhile, I'm using my Ubuntu mainly for [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/) development, so I might as well just do everything <u>***locally***</u>.

This way, I don't have to worry about the things I've mentioned, plus I gain the following advantages for my situation:

- Performance boost on my potatop.
- Running multiple sites at the same time and developing simultaneously, which crazy creative when it comes to simple ideas here and there!
- Customizations such as SSL and 3rd party tools setup is way easier if you deal with it locally; and doesn't necessarily mean that you'd a have a messy setup.
- Package development, when having most of the tools installed out of boxes!

## Installation

- Extract the scripter somewhere and navigate into it:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Downloads && unzip ./tall-stacker-x.x.x.zip -d ./ && cd tall-stacker-x.x.x
  ```

- Create a [[.env](./.env)] file from the [[.env.example](./.env.example)] one, check its content and then fill it in; replacing the `<placeholders>`.
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env && nano .env
  ```

- Run the script with super-user permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo ./tall-stacker.sh
  ```

- Ensure that the environment variables are all showing up in the output before selecting anything.

- Choose to [**setup**](./scripts/setup.sh) the tall stacker first, which will install everything necessary and eventually create a [[done-setup](./done-setup)] empty file in the directory.

- Then choose to [**create**](./scripts/create.sh) your first tall stack project and provide it its name.

That's it. You'll have your first project accessible in the end (displaying the site's URL too). JUST be PATIENT! `:)`

> **Warning**
> Please remember to install the "recommended extensions" after opening the VSC Workspace as prompted to.

> **Note**
> You're free to take a look at and apply the VSC [settings](./files/.opinionated/settings.json) I'm using locally, as well as their complete [extension list](./files/.opinionated/extensions.md). (You can also set up both in their own "tall" VSC profile or something)


## Before Production

- Reset [app/Http/Middleware/TrustedProxies.php]'s property to `protected $proxies;`


## Todos For Development:

- [ ] Quiet out the setup script and test it! ðŸŒš
- [ ] Auto-complete or suggestion mechanism while deleting the project
  - [ ] OR selection mechanism with an interface listing projects in rectangles (arrow up and down then enter)
- [ ] Open VSC if available (check the commented code in [scripts/create.sh])
- [ ] Run PHPUnit tests with the keybinding (ctrl+shift+r) if in PHPUnit class, and BetterPest's otherwise
- [ ] Selective installation process (check [.draft/stacking-wip.md])
- [ ] Blurred Image
- [ ] TheatreJS


## Changelogs

### v1.0.2
- Fixed a folder name type

### v1.0.1
- Added PHP Resolver extension settings locally (opening PHP files outside workspace folders won't throw exceptions)
- Considered [/var/www/html/.packages] folder in the VSC workspace

### v1.0.0
- Setup packages and services
- List projects
- create a project
- delete a project
